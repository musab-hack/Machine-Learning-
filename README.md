# Machine Learning with MNIST datasets, Complete Tutorial with Explanation
## In this complete tutorial, I have been discussing some major concepts related
  1) Cost Function and How you can use it.
  2) Linear Regression Problems
  3) Overfitting of Datasets
  4) Non-Linear and Linear Regression statement 
  
  
## We will be using Stochastic Gradient Decent as Classifier in this tutorial because We are here using the Stohastic Gradient Decent (SGD). This classifier has the advantage of being capable of handling very large datasets efficiently. This is in part because SGD deals with training instances independently, one at a time (which also makes SGD well suited for online learning).

## Performance Measure
cross_val_score() function to evaluate your SGDClassifier model using K-fold cross-validation, with three folds.
## Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or "classifier") on a set of test data for which the true values are known.
### Formula to calculate precision precision = TP/ (TP + FP) TP = True Positive vise versa
## Precision & Recall
Precision can be seen as a measure of quality, and recall as a measure of quantity. Higher precision means that an algorithm returns more relevant results than irrelevant ones, and high recall means that an algorithm returns most of the relevant results (whether or not irrelevant ones are also returned).
## F1 Score
Harmonic Mean of the precision and Recall value is F1 Score

## In this Tutorial, I will guide you how you can use Best Threshold for your Precision Recall Curve
