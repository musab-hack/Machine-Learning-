# Machine Learning with MNIST datasets, Complete Tutorial with Explanation
## In this complete tutorial, I have been discussing some major concepts related
  1) Cost Function and How you can use it.
  2) Linear Regression Problems
  3) Overfitting of Datasets
  4) Non-Linear and Linear Regression statement 
  
  
## We will be using Stochastic Gradient Decent as Classifier in this tutorial because We are here using the Stohastic Gradient Decent (SGD). This classifier has the advantage of being capable of handling very large datasets efficiently. This is in part because SGD deals with training instances independently, one at a time (which also makes SGD well suited for online learning).

# Performance Measure
## cross_val_score() function to evaluate your SGDClassifier model using K-fold cross-validation, with three folds.
